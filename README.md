# FACrystalQuantMacro

ImageJ Macro files for the quantification of renal folic acid crystals from whole-slice tranverse sections imaged in brightfield without staining. One file automates the segmentation of the crystals and their quantification against the segmented total tissue. The other file generates a Euclidean distance map for the visualization and quantification of folic acid crystal spatial distribution in the kidney.
